AIE Year1 Code Design and Data Structures Assessment

A basic asteroids type clone that was submitted as part of my first year Code Design and Data Structures assessment at Academy of Interactive Entertainment.
It's important that my programs run efficiently so I implemented an object pooling system so that rocks that have been shot down are just not deleted from memory but are reused. This optimises memory resources for improved performance and reduced fragmentation.

Duration of development: Around 3-4 Weeks

Features and functionality implemented:
- Vectors
- Object pooling
- Linear interpolation for smooth movement
- Simple collision detection
- Simple particle effects
